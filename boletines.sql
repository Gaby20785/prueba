While strawberries are traditionally associated with summer, their dedicated day falls in winter—a time when cultivating these climate-sensitive fruits presents significant challenges. Given their need for warmth and sunlight, UK growers must carefully manage growing conditions to ensure a year-round supply. “At Tomtech, we’re celebrating National Strawberry Day! Despite the UK’s cold, wet, and dark winters, climate-sensitive fruit like strawberries can still be grown to their full potential. By leveraging greenhouses reinforced with environmental control systems to ensure optimal environmental conditions, our store shelves can be kept fully stocked with homegrown strawberries and other soft fruits,” says Krzysztof Hernik, Managing Director at Tomtech.

(7, 'World-First Entirely Autonomous Parsnip Crop Grown – An Agritech Breakthrough', '\r  Huntapac’s parsnip crop, grown without human machinery operation, used Skippy Scout drone monitoring operated by Agrii’s technical experts in the world’s first instance of entirely autonomous vegetable agronomy and production. Huntapac, in collaboration with Autonomous Agri Solutions, AutoSpray Systems and Agrii, funded by the Marks and Spencer Plan A Accelerator Fund, successfully grew a crop of parsnips autonomously. This achievement is believed to be a world first. The field-scale trial is the most recent step in a series of trials investigating how to improve the sustainability of Huntapc’s carrot and parsnip production, says Stephen Shields, technical and sustainability director at Huntapac. “We have done a lot of work looking at low-carbon fertilisers. We started doing 80 acres and have expanded that to 1,700 acres this year.” This work has been combined with an autonomous field concept, which is when Agrii and the other partners became involved. It coincided with Marks and Spencer launching the Accelerator Fund to discover innovative technologies that will enable its rapid progress towards becoming a net zero business across its supply chain by 2040.  To prepare the field, an Ageed electric drive autonomous tractor was used for primary and secondary cultivation, says Tom Beach of Autonomous Agri Solutions.  “That was able to do the subsoiling operations and ploughing, which was the first case of autonomous ploughing in the UK. Finally, it did the bed tilling. “A Robotti was utilised for the following lighter operations. We use this because it has a standard three-point hitch to use conventional agricultural implements, but it is substantially lighter and more accurate than a tractor.” The crop was drilled using a single-bed Stanhay -Series drill, comparable to what is used in a conventional tractor pulled triple-bed drill. Tom believes that the longer work hours possible using autonomous technology means that smaller-width implements will deliver at least the same efficiency as larger human-operated ones. The Robotti was responsible for the weed control, spraying the pre-emergence herbicide across the entire bed width. Subsequent applications were made post-emergence using a band sprayer on the rows and an inter-row hoe between them. The project called on AutoSpray Systems’ expertise in drone spraying for variable rate and selective biopesticide and fertiliser applications. Robert Pearson, CEO of AutoSpray Systems, explains that the technology is well-equipped for the precise application of pesticides. However, what drones can apply is limited by regulation because plant protection products approved for use in parsnips need specific approval for aerial application. Most biopesticides and fertilisers can be applied through the drone system, says Robert. To monitor the crop and guide the precise application of plant protection products, Agrii used a drone equipped with Skippy Scout to do the agronomy. Skippy Scout is a software system that will automatically fly a drone to selected points in a field and send high-resolution, leaf-level images to aid with decision-making. The system analyses the captured images and sends a field report, explains Jonathan Trotter, technology trials manager for Agrii. He used a drone to collect data from the field every few weeks. Parsnips were not a crop that Skippy Scout was working with before the project. “That’s a really nice element of the project; we’re developing the AI in the background to use Skippy Scout in parsnips going forward.” “We’ve reported back to the group every time we have surveyed the field. The idea is that we can then deploy the other technologies accordingly,” explains Jonathan. “Skippy Scout helps identify the areas to be treated, which can be inputted into our app to treat those areas specifically,” says Robert. “We’ve been asked if our (spray) drones can do the same level of crop monitoring, and our response is absolutely not. That’s where Skippy Scout is a perfect solution. “We believe this method will allow conventional chemistry to remain on the market for longer because you apply much less of it using our precise process. At the same time, it allows us to apply more novel products much more easily.” Robert used the drone to apply bio-fungicides to the crop for disease prevention. This is a task a drone is especially well-suited to because the airflow from the propellers agitates the canopy, giving excellent leaf coverage for the bio-fungicide. The successful field-scale trial has demonstrated a 46% reduction in carbon emissions and significant labour and input savings. Naturally, thoughts move to how the system developed by the group can be rolled out on a larger scale. Interoperability between the systems controlling the decision support tools and machinery is a crucial milestone. This is a challenge Agrii has already begun working on. “We are integrating Skippy Scout with our digital platform, Contour,” says Jonathan. “This can then be linked to soil mapping through Rhiza, and further into the future, it could export treatment recommendations to the other technologies used within this very project.” Tom Beach says the sprayer on the Robotti is already equipped and ready to do this. “It has the standard Topcon ISOBUS, giving us full variable rate capability. We can input field maps or shape files, whatever the source is.” The data could originate from an agronomist or decision support system like Contour. As well as applying variable rates across the sprayer’s width, Robotti can be programmed only to treat specific areas and return ‘as-applied’ data through its Crop Eye camera. More precise digital record-keeping will benefit Huntapac’s relationship with its suppliers, says Stephen Shields. “The request from our customers is to have full electronic traceability throughout the process. For some, that’s from 2025.” Tom concludes by saying that regardless of the ag tech’s sophistication, external factors like the weather and soil conditions will still dictate how the crop is grown. “As much as we can automate the sensing and recommendations, we are a long way from removing a human from the decision-making process. “Robots will do whatever you tell them, but knowing what to tell them still requires a huge amount of skill.” Source: Direct Driller ', 'https://www.agritechfuture.com/robotics-automation/world-first-entirely-autonomous-parsnip-crop-grown-an-agritech-breakthrough/'),
(8, 'How Non-Browning Bananas will Pioneer the Future of Fruit Shelf-Life', '\r  UK-based plant biotechnology company Tropic is set to revolutionise the banana industry with the launch of its non-browning bananas in March, followed by extended shelf-life bananas by year-end. These innovations aim to expand the cut-fruit market, combat food waste, unlock new export opportunities, and slash shipping costs. But that’s not all—Tropic is also accelerating field trials for its Cavendish bananas resistant to fusarium wilt (TR4), a devastating fungal disease threatening banana crops worldwide. Founded in 2016 by Gilad Gershon and Eyal Maori, Tropic has gained global recognition for its Gene Editing Induced Gene Silencing (GEiGS) technology. This cutting-edge approach uses RNA interference (RNAi) to help plants fend off fungal and viral threats. However, the company’s latest non-browning and extended shelf-life bananas are the result of CRISPR gene-editing techniques. Cavendish bananas, the dominant variety in global markets, are sterile and seedless, making them difficult to breed using traditional methods. Scientists have had to engineer genetic variation through techniques like mutagenesis, genetic modification, somaclonal variation, or gene editing. According to Gilad Gershon, the non-browning bananas maintain the same taste and sweetness but are far more resistant to browning, making them ideal for fruit salads and pre-cut fruit products. “Browning is driven by polyphenol oxidase, an enzyme that oxidises phenolic compounds—just like in apples and potatoes,” Gershon explained. Tropic’s bananas have already secured regulatory approvals in the Philippines, Colombia, Honduras, the USA, and Canada, with more approvals on the horizon. Set to debut later this year, Tropic’s extended shelf-life bananas could transform global banana logistics. Gershon noted that bananas are traditionally harvested green to delay ripening during transport. By knocking out genes responsible for ethylene production, the fruit stays greener for longer, allowing for later harvests, extended shipping durations, and significant cost reductions in packaging and transportation. In addition to its consumer-focused innovations, Tropic is making major strides in disease resistance. Its GEiGS-powered TR4-resistant bananas use the plant’s natural RNAi mechanisms to silence key fungal genes, offering a non-GMO solution to one of the banana industry’s most pressing threats. Field trials have already shown strong resistance, with more trials planned across multiple locations. Tropic is collaborating with leading banana companies to bring its TR4-resistant bananas to market. Beyond bananas, Tropic has licensed its GEiGS technology to major agricultural players like Corteva, British Sugar, and Genus, enabling applications in both crops and livestock. With approximately $80 million raised and continued revenue through strategic partnerships, Tropic is cementing its position as a leader in plant biotechnology. With its upcoming product launches and disease-resistant breakthroughs, Tropic is not just reshaping bananas—it’s redefining the future of fruit innovation.

(9, 'UK Government’s Soil Health Policies: Support for Growers or Falling Short?', '\r  The UK government has placed soil health at the heart of its agricultural policies, recognising its vital role in sustaining crop yields and ensuring long-term food security. However, while schemes such as the Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI) and Environmental Land Management (ELM) offer financial support to farmers adopting soil-friendly practices, many in the industry argue that the measures lack sufficient funding, accessibility, and long-term vision. With soil degradation posing a serious threat to productivity, the government faces mounting pressure to bridge the gap between policy ambitions and the practical needs of British farmers. The government has introduced several initiatives aimed at improving soil health, including financial incentives for practices such as cover cropping, reduced tillage, and organic matter enrichment. These methods help improve nutrient retention, water infiltration, and root development, which are all essential for maintaining high yields. Through the Sustainable Farming Incentive, farmers can apply for payments to implement these soil-enhancing practices, with Defra arguing that this will lead to better long-term resilience and sustainability in UK agriculture. Meanwhile, government-backed research into precision farming is equipping growers with real-time soil monitoring tools, helping them optimise soil management and maximise yields. Despite these steps forward, many farmers report frustrations with funding delays and restrictive eligibility criteria. The transition from the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) to the UK’s post-Brexit system has seen a shift towards ‘public money for public goods’, rewarding sustainable practices rather than direct subsidies. While this is intended to promote environmental stewardship, critics argue that payments are too slow and often insufficient to cover the costs of transitioning to new methods. Smaller farmers, in particular, say they struggle to access the financial support needed to invest in soil aeration equipment, organic matter improvements, and other regenerative practices. Some feel that government schemes favour larger agricultural businesses, leaving independent growers at a disadvantage. The government has set ambitious targets for carbon sequestration and soil restoration, positioning soil health as a key tool in tackling climate change. However, some industry leaders caution that climate-focused policies should not come at the expense of economic viability for farmers. For example, while the Environmental Land Management (ELM) scheme encourages growers to improve soil organic matter, some fear that the financial incentives do not fully compensate for reduced productivity on land set aside for environmental purposes. Others worry that the emphasis on sustainability measures fails to acknowledge the immediate financial pressures many farmers face, particularly with rising input costs and market uncertainty. While the government insists that its policies are designed to support long-term soil health and farm profitability, industry voices are calling for greater collaboration between policymakers and farmers to ensure these initiatives are practical and accessible. Some experts argue that a more flexible funding model—one that better reflects the diverse needs of British agriculture—would help farmers transition to sustainable practices without jeopardising their businesses. As soil health continues to play a crucial role in agricultural productivity, the UK government will need to strike a balance between environmental goals and economic sustainability. The coming years will determine whether current policies offer genuine long-term solutions or whether further reforms will be necessary to keep Britain’s growers on stable ground.

(10, 'Driving the Future of Farming with Renewable Agricultural Technology', '\r  Renewable agricultural technology is rapidly transforming the landscape of modern farming, delivering a range of benefits that encompass sustainability, efficiency, and profitability. By harnessing renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power, farmers can significantly reduce operating costs, lessen their environmental impact, and create more resilient business models. Below, we explore how these innovations are reshaping agriculture. Reduced Energy CostsAdopting renewables, particularly solar panels or wind turbines, can substantially lower energy bills by providing a stable and often cheaper alternative to traditional fossil fuels. In an industry where profit margins can be tight, these savings can have a remarkable impact on a farm’s bottom line. Energy IndependenceBy generating their own power, farmers reduce reliance on external suppliers, enhancing both energy security and operational stability. This independence helps mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating fuel prices and potential supply disruptions. Lower Greenhouse Gas EmissionsThe shift towards renewable energy in agriculture directly reduces the sector’s carbon footprint, helping to mitigate climate change. Embracing solar or wind power, for instance, means fewer emissions and a far cleaner environmental profile. Minimised Environmental ImpactRenewable technologies help curb pollution by cutting down on the harmful by-products often associated with fossil fuels.

(11, 'UK Scientists Uncover Plant Mechanism That Boosts Soil Microbe Partnerships', '\r  Researchers at the John Innes Centre in Norwich, Norfolk, have identified a biological process that enhances plant root interactions with soil microbes. This discovery could pave the way for crop varieties that require less nitrate and phosphate fertiliser, offering a more sustainable approach to agriculture. “We can now think of developing a new type of environmentally friendly farming with crops that require less artificial fertiliser,” said Dr Myriam Charpentier, who led the research team. The excessive use of fertilisers has become a growing environmental issue, contributing to soil degradation and causing nutrient run-offs that pollute rivers. These run-offs encourage algae blooms, which deplete oxygen levels in the water, harming fish and other aquatic life. The research has pinpointed a way to potentially address this challenge by enabling crops to extract nutrients from the soil more efficiently with the help of soil microbes. This approach is based on a natural process called endosymbiosis, where one organism lives within another in a mutually beneficial relationship. In the wild, some plants already use microbial partnerships to access nutrients in poor soils, but modern agricultural practices—particularly fertiliser use—disrupt these interactions. Charpentier’s team discovered a specific mutation in the legume Medicago truncatula that strengthens its relationship with bacteria and fungi, which, in turn, help supply the plant with nitrogen and phosphorus. Notably, the researchers found that the same genetic mutation in wheat produced similar results under real field conditions. This breakthrough could lead to the development of wheat varieties capable of harnessing soil microbes for nutrients, reducing reliance on synthetic fertilisers. “This discovery is created in a wheat variety that is non-GM,” Charpentier added, highlighting that traditional breeding methods could be used to incorporate this trait into commercial crops. The findings, recently published in Nature, have sparked enthusiasm in the scientific and agricultural communities. Charpentier described the discovery as having “great potential for advancing sustainable agriculture,” offering hope for a future where natural microbial interactions replace the need for high fertiliser inputs in major crops.

(13, 'Innovation in the Fields: Cultivating a Secure Food Future for the UK', '\r  Agricultural innovation is emerging as a key driver in helping UK growers achieve food security in an era marked by climate change, resource scarcity and increasing global demand. With modern techniques and groundbreaking research, the agricultural sector is witnessing a transformation that not only enhances crop yields but also bolsters the resilience of farming communities across the United Kingdom. One of the most significant advancements is the integration of precision farming technologies. By utilising satellite imagery, drones and sensor systems, farmers can monitor crop health in real time, allowing them to optimise irrigation, fertilisation and pest control measures. This data-driven approach reduces waste, minimises environmental impact and ensures that each crop receives exactly what it needs at each stage of its growth. According to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), “Precision agriculture has the potential to increase productivity by up to 15% while reducing resource use by 20%.” Another area of innovation is the development of climate-resilient crop varieties. Research institutions, such as the John Innes Centre and Rothamsted Research, are at the forefront of breeding plants that can withstand extreme weather conditions and resist pests and diseases. These innovations are particularly crucial in the face of unpredictable weather patterns. Dr Sarah Williams of Rothamsted Research stated, “Developing resilient crop varieties is not just about sustaining yields – it’s about ensuring the long-term viability of our food systems in a changing climate.” Moreover, the digital revolution is opening up new frontiers for farmers. The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning in agriculture is enabling more precise predictions about weather patterns, disease outbreaks and optimal planting times. These tools empower growers to make informed decisions, reducing the risks associated with farming in a volatile climate. AI-driven models are already being used in pilot projects around the UK, where early results have demonstrated significant improvements in both efficiency and yield. Innovative practices extend beyond technology alone. Sustainable methods such as regenerative agriculture are being adopted by a growing number of UK farmers. These techniques focus on enhancing soil health through practices like cover cropping, reduced tillage and crop rotation, which in turn sequester carbon and improve water retention. As noted by Professor John Smith of the University of Reading, “Regenerative agriculture represents a holistic approach that not only improves soil quality but also contributes to mitigating climate change. It’s a win-win for food security and the environment.” Collaboration between the government, academic institutions and the private sector is crucial for the successful implementation of these innovations. Public-private partnerships, such as the UK Agri-Tech Strategy, are working to bridge the gap between research and practical application. This coordinated effort ensures that breakthroughs in agricultural science translate into tangible benefits for growers across the country. Ultimately, agricultural innovation offers a promising pathway to enhanced food security for UK growers. By embracing precision farming, developing climate-resilient crops, utilising AI and adopting sustainable practices, the agricultural sector is becoming more efficient, resilient and environmentally friendly. As the UK continues to navigate the challenges of the 21st century, these innovations are essential in securing a stable and sustainable food supply for future generations.

(15, 'UK Government Unveils Plan to Transform 10% of Farmland for Net Zero Goals', '\r  In a bold initiative to combat climate change and promote sustainable land use, the UK government has announced a comprehensive plan to repurpose a significant portion of England’s farmland by 2050.  The strategy aims to convert approximately 10% of agricultural land into solar farms, forests, and nature reserves, aligning with the nation’s ambitious net zero targets. Environment Secretary Steve Reed emphasised the plan’s balance between environmental stewardship and food production, stating that the strategy would “ensure that we continue to produce the food we need while enhancing our natural environment.” However, government analyses acknowledge uncertainties regarding the impact on food production, indicating that while the strategy is designed to maintain current levels, external factors could influence outcomes. The Land Use Framework outlines a dual approach: alongside the 10% conversion, an additional 5% of farmland will transition to less intensive farming practices, incorporating more space for nature. This approach seeks to halt the decline in biodiversity, support housing development, and increase forest cover across the country. Specific regions, including the Lake District and Devon, are identified for significant land use changes due to their unique environmental characteristics. The government has initiated a 12-week consultation period to engage with farmers and stakeholders, offering incentives for those willing to adapt their land use in line with the framework’s objectives. Despite the plan’s forward-looking vision, it has faced criticism for potential risks to food security and delays in implementation. Shadow Environment Secretary Victoria Atkins expressed concerns, stating, “This strategy is long overdue and lacks the legal backing needed to ensure its success.” The Land Use Framework represents a significant step in balancing the UK’s environmental goals with the demands of a growing population. By integrating sustainable practices into land management, the government aims to create a resilient agricultural sector that supports both ecological diversity and food production. As the consultation progresses, the effectiveness of the framework will depend on collaborative efforts between policymakers, farmers, and local communities to navigate the challenges and opportunities presented by this transformative plan.

(16, 'UK Agritech Sector Poised for Transformation Amidst Key Challenges', '\r  The UK’s agritech sector is at a pivotal juncture, with the potential to revolutionise agriculture both domestically and globally. However, a recent report by the Innovation and Research Caucus (IRC) highlights significant barriers hindering this progress, including infrastructure gaps, funding challenges, and the need for enhanced collaboration among stakeholders. The report identifies a “funding cliff” that many businesses encounter during the commercialisation and scaling-up phases. An industry expert noted that securing the substantial investment required for later-stage developments becomes “very, very difficult in the UK.” Echoing this sentiment, a business leader emphasised the scarcity of a robust investment community within the country, stating, “Finance, finance, finance, and the lack of a good investment community inside the United Kingdom.” Infrastructure deficits further impede the sector’s growth. A respondent from a crop gene editing company highlighted the prohibitive costs associated with establishing necessary facilities: “Well, we have a huge issue in the gene editing space… there’s a huge initial cost required to start working in this area… So anybody who wants to enter into this market… needs to recreate all of the facilities themselves and that’s incredibly expensive… you need 10 million and that’s a huge ask for investors… there’s a huge need in the UK… for this centralisation of facilities that companies would be able to lease.” The report also underscores misaligned expectations among technology developers, farmers, and funders, which often impede progress. An expert observed, “There’s misaligned expectations… what can be delivered, the pace at which it can be delivered, and the return on investment for the farmers.” Additionally, the high costs and limited awareness of new technologies among farmers slow the adoption of innovations. A business respondent from an agritech project development company expressed scepticism about the market’s ability to afford expensive technologies, even if they improve efficiency and productivity. To overcome these challenges, the report outlines several strategic investment areas, including developing high-TRL infrastructure, fostering collaborative funding models, and introducing tiered funding schemes. One interviewee emphasised the importance of Innovate UK’s role, stating, “Innovate UK provided us with the essential funding that allowed us to develop our prototype. Without their support, we would have struggled to move forward.” However, there remains a need for greater funding support for technologies closer to the market. The report advocates for the development of a national agritech roadmap to provide clear guidance for stakeholders, inspire investor confidence, and accelerate technology adoption. This comprehensive strategy could include a directory of recommended technologies tailored to specific crops and conditions, addressing the confusion many farmers face when navigating the diverse agritech landscape. By addressing its current shortcomings and leveraging its innovative capabilities, the UK’s agritech sector has the potential to become a global leader in sustainable agriculture, driving significant advancements in productivity and promoting environmental sustainability. The road ahead requires coordinated and collaborative efforts from policymakers, funders, farmers, and industry leaders, but the rewards—economic, environmental, and societal—are well worth the investment.

Farmers face an ever-growing list of challenges: climate change, labour shortages, and the relentless demand for greater efficiency and sustainability. But amidst this sea of uncertainty lies a game-changing technology that promises to transform how we grow, harvest, and distribute food—portable 5G. For years, farmers in rural areas have struggled with limited access to high-speed internet. It’s a frustration I’ve heard time and again: poor connectivity can make even the simplest digital tools almost impossible to use. Portable 5G could change all of this, providing the ultra-fast, reliable, and flexible connectivity needed to fully embrace the potential of modern agricultural technologies. But what makes portable 5G so powerful is not just its speed—it’s its portability. Unlike fixed networks, portable 5G allows farmers to set up temporary connectivity wherever it’s needed. Imagine a crop-spraying drone being remotely controlled in real-time over a 5G network. Picture a pop-up farm office or livestock monitoring station powered by a mobile signal strong enough to handle data-heavy operations like AI-based pest detection or soil analysis. These are not distant dreams—they’re possibilities already within reach. Portable 5G unlocks the potential of precision agriculture, where every decision is guided by data. Sensors embedded in the soil can transmit real-time information on moisture levels, pH, and nutrient availability, helping farmers optimise irrigation and fertiliser use with pinpoint accuracy. With 5G, this data can flow seamlessly from field to cloud, enabling instant analysis and actionable insights. More importantly, the connectivity can support fleets of autonomous machinery working together across large fields. These machines can communicate with each other, coordinating tasks like planting, harvesting, or even weeding, all while minimising energy use and waste. The key enabler here is low-latency communication—the kind that only 5G can provide. Sustainability is no longer a buzzword—it’s an imperative. Portable 5G could help the sector slash its carbon footprint by enabling smarter logistics and supply chains. Real-time data on weather conditions, crop readiness, and market demand can help reduce waste, lower transportation costs, and ensure that produce reaches consumers fresher than ever before. Even livestock farming stands to benefit. Farmers can use portable 5G to monitor animal health remotely through wearable tech, reducing the need for physical inspections and enabling early intervention when issues arise. It’s a win-win for animal welfare and operational efficiency. Of course, like any innovation, portable 5G is not without its challenges. Cost is a significant barrier for small-scale farmers who may struggle to justify the initial investment. There’s also the issue of education—many farmers need support to understand how to integrate 5G-enabled technologies into their existing operations effectively. Partnerships between tech providers, agricultural organisations, and the government will be crucial to ensuring equitable access and uptake. Moreover, concerns about cybersecurity cannot be ignored. As farms become increasingly connected, they become potential targets for cyberattacks. Strong safeguards must be in place to protect sensitive data and maintain operational integrity. The beauty of portable 5G lies in its potential to democratise digital farming. It’s a technology that can bring cutting-edge tools to the most remote corners of the UK, levelling the playing field and enabling every farmer to benefit from the Fourth Agricultural Revolution. But for this revolution to truly take hold, we need action. Policymakers must incentivise investment in rural connectivity, while agricultural leaders and tech innovators must work together to educate and empower farmers. The challenges facing UK agriculture are undeniable, but with portable 5G, we have an opportunity to turn those challenges into triumphs. The future of farming is connected, efficient, and sustainable—and it starts now.

The findings offer some intriguing insights. To clarify, the 5G availability figures represent the percentage of users with 5G-enabled devices who spend the majority of their time connected to 5G networks. This should not be confused with population or geographic coverage metrics, which measure broader network reach. As reported earlier this week, the United Kingdom currently has a national 5G availability score of 42.2%, placing it behind much of Europe. This performance gap has been attributed to various factors explored previously. However, Ookla has now provided ISPreview with updated data on 5G availability by network operator, highlighting changes between Q4 2023 and Q4 2024. The results show EE leading with a 5G availability score of 67.45%. While EE may not consistently outpace Three UK in terms of 5G speeds, its availability more than doubles that of its closest competitor. O2 follows with a score of 46.11%, performing significantly better in availability compared to its usual position at the bottom of many performance studies. Three UK secures third place with 31.1%, while Vodafone trails far behind with a disappointing 16.37%. These discrepancies are likely influenced by the robustness of existing 4G infrastructure and the gradual rollout of true end-to-end 5G Standalone networks. However, Vodafone’s relatively poor performance compared to its peers, and O2’s stronger-than-expected showing, remain surprising developments in the ongoing evolution of UK mobile networks.
